export const AbMission = "I build frontends that are intuitive, sleek, and fast. Too often, software tools arenâ€™t designed for the average user. Software should be accessible to everyone, not just those of us who were lucky enough to grow surrounded by technology. My goal is to master frontend development so that I can create products that users are excited to interact with."
